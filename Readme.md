# Mission: keeping my wife on track

This is a little side project to remind my wife to stay healthy. I really has nothing to do with any of my work or machine learning, I just wanted to try to build a web app. Ideally, you'll look at my other projects instead.

In case you want to do something similar for yourself:
- check the main.py where the list is actually compiled. Add or subtract whatever you want for yourself.
- change the weekdays for tasks like workouts to your preferences.
- make your own workout routine as seen e.g. in workout_away and workout_home. Utils like logging and set structures are already implemented in the utils, you just need to add the sets and exercises.
Good luck with your own habits!
